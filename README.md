# PRoot - Virtual Root Filesystem for Linux

`proot` is a tool that allows you to create and run a virtual root filesystem without requiring root privileges. It is commonly used for running software and emulating environments in a way that mimics a true root filesystem.

## Why Use PRoot?

PRoot provides a flexible and safe way to:

- **Run a Linux distribution inside another distribution**: You can run an Ubuntu-based system inside a CentOS, or even a different architecture like ARM on an x86 machine.
- **Create isolated environments (sandboxing)**: PRoot allows you to isolate applications or processes within a virtual environment without requiring root access.
- **Test software**: Developers can use PRoot to quickly set up different environments for testing without modifying the main system.
- **Run root-required applications**: Some applications require root access to run, and PRoot enables running them safely within a confined environment.

## Features

- **No Root Access Needed**: You can run a full Linux environment without needing `sudo` or root privileges.
- **Cross-architecture Emulation**: Supports running ARM binaries on x86_64, or other architectures.
- **Filesystem Redirection**: Redirects system calls to different root filesystems, enabling running of programs with different root filesystems.
- **Customizable Environments**: You can mount directories and bind resources, and run software in an isolated environment with its own set of libraries and dependencies.

## Installation

To use PRoot, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download PRoot** for your architecture. You can download it directly or compile from source.

   Example (download):
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foxytouxxx/freeroot/main/proot-${ARCH} -O /usr/local/bin/proot
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/proot
   ```

2. **Install the required root filesystem**: You can use a tarball from a supported Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) and extract it into your working directory.

   Example:
   ```bash
   wget "http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/20.04/release/ubuntu-base-20.04.4-base-${ARCH}.tar.gz" -O /tmp/rootfs.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf /tmp/rootfs.tar.gz -C /path/to/rootfs/
   ```

3. **Run PRoot with the new root filesystem**:
   ```bash
   proot --rootfs=/path/to/rootfs/ -0 -w /root -b /dev -b /sys -b /proc -b /etc/resolv.conf --kill-on-exit
   ```

## How to Use PRoot

Once installed, you can use PRoot to run a program or even an entire Linux environment with a different root filesystem.

Example command to start a PRoot environment:

```bash
proot --rootfs=/path/to/ubuntu-rootfs -0 -w /root -b /dev -b /sys -b /proc -b /etc/resolv.conf --kill-on-exit
```

This command:

- Uses `/path/to/ubuntu-rootfs` as the virtual root filesystem.
- Sets `/root` as the working directory inside the new environment.
- Binds important directories (`/dev`, `/sys`, `/proc`) to make the environment functional.
- Makes sure the environment cleans up after itself when the process exits.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Run a Minimal Ubuntu Environment

You can easily run a minimal Ubuntu environment inside your current Linux system:

```bash
proot --rootfs=/path/to/ubuntu-rootfs -0 -w /root
```

### 2. Run ARM Software on x86_64

If you're on an x86_64 system but want to run ARM binaries, PRoot makes it possible:

```bash
proot --rootfs=/path/to/arm-rootfs -0 -w /root -b /dev -b /sys -b /proc -b /etc/resolv.conf
```

### 3. Testing and Development

PRoot is great for isolating development environments, allowing you to test software in different root filesystems or architectures without impacting your primary system.

## Limitations

- **Performance**: Running programs inside a virtualized environment may be slower than running them natively.
- **Complexity**: While powerful, using PRoot with various root filesystems can be tricky for newcomers.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permissions issues**: Make sure you have the correct permissions to read and write to the directories you bind (`/dev`, `/sys`, `/proc`, etc.).
- **Missing dependencies**: If a program inside the PRoot environment fails to run, make sure the necessary libraries and dependencies are available in the root filesystem you're using.

## Contributing

If you find any issues or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request in the repository.

---

PRoot provides an easy way to experiment with different Linux environments, without needing to modify your system or have root access. Whether you're a developer, a tester, or just curious, it's a powerful tool for creating isolated environments on your system.
